# Simulated Annaeling

## what is Simulated Annaeling

Simulated annealing is a probabilictic method proposed in Kirkpatrick, Gelett
and Vecchi (1983) and Cerni (1985) for finding the global minimum of a cost
function that may possess several local minima. It works by emulating the
physical processs whereby a solid is slowly cooled so that when eventually its
structure is "frozen", this happens at a minimum energy configuration.

## note

this library i made when i have a mid term in "Artificial Intelligent" in ITB (master degree),
hope this library will be useful in your education/project.

you can see main.c for example using this library.
this library is really simple, only sa.c and sa.h :-)
